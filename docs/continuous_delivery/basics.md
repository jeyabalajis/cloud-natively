# Continuous Delivery - Basics

[Continuous Delivery](https://continuousdelivery.com/) is the ability to get changes of all types—including new features, configuration changes, bug fixes and experiments—into production, or into the hands of users, safely and quickly in a sustainable way.

## Principles

There are five principles at the heart of continuous delivery:

- **Build quality in**: It’s much cheaper to fix problems and defects if we find them immediately—ideally before they are ever checked into version control, by running automated tests locally.
- **Work in small batches**: In continuous delivery, we try and get every change in version control as far towards release as we can, gettting comprehensive feedback as rapidly as possible.
- **Computers perform repetitive tasks, people solve problems**: Use automation to perform simple, repetitive tasks, and free up humans to focus on problem-solving.
- **Relentlessly pursue continuous improvement**: Don’t treat transformation as a project to be embarked on and then completed so we can return to business as usual. Embrace Kaizen, and treat Continuous Delivery as a Continuous Journey.
- **Everyone is responsible**: In high performing organizations, nothing is “somebody else’s problem.” Everyone works together to achieve the organizational level goals, rather than optimizing for what’s best for their team or department.
